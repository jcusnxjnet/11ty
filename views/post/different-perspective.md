It's not a bad thing when someone gives you a different perspective on things. Once, I quit my job and stayed home for eight months. I like to talk about how much work I got done on the house, how I spent time traveling with my family, how much I read, and how great it all was. Today, my son said to me: 'Do you mean the time you quit your job and then spent eight months at home playing Minesweeper?'
